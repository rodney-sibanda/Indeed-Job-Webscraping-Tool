# Indeed Job Webscraping Tool

This project is a Selenium-based web scraper developed for the GNWT Bureau of Statistics. It retrieves up-to-date job market data from Indeed for the Northwest Territories (NWT). Previously, the Resource Statistician relied on estimates provided by Statistics Canada, which often did not reflect the current job market accurately. This tool bridges that gap by providing real-time data to generate reliable reports, giving a clearer picture of the job market in the NWT.

- **Location-Specific Scraping:** Fetches job postings for the Northwest Territories.
- Dynamic Filters: Filters job postings by date and sorts them for the most recent updates.

**Comprehensive Data Extraction:**

- Company name
- Location
- Salary

- Data Logging: Saves the extracted job data into an Excel file for further analysis.
- Automated Pagination: Scrapes multiple pages of job postings automatically.
